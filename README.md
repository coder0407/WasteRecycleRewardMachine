# WasteRecycleRewardMachine

This project was made as a DBMS mini project for 5th semester DBMS laboratory.

The features of this project include - 
1. Users can deposit waste item and they get rewarded with coupons.
2. Companies can place order with us for these waste scrapes.

This encourages users to recycle waste items along with making the task of recycling waste easy by organising the data into a database.
